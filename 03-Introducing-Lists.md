# Introducing Lists

A list is a collection of items, in a certain order. It's index is counted from 0, for example, if you have a list with 10 items, your 10th item corresponds with the index 9. You can also reference the las item as -1, the previous one as -2 and so on.

## Basic Operations
- Create a list
newList = ['value1' , 'value2' , 'value3']

- Show values
print(newList)
['value1' , 'value2' , 'value3']

- Show values per index
print(newList[0])

- Show last value
print(newList[-1])

- Concatenate
print ("The " + newList[0] + " is the first element in my list")

- Number of elements in your list
list.len()

## Edit, Insert and delete
- Replace existing value per index
newList[0] = "newValue"

- Insert new value
newList.insert(0, "newValue")
# The rest of values are moved one place to the right.

- Delete per index
del list[0]
# You can use it when you know the index of the value or item you want to delete.

- Delete per value
list.remove(value1)
# You can use when you know the value, but not the index, it deletes only the first occurrence.

- Delete the last value and use it
LastValueSaved = list.pop()
#Deletes the last value at the same time you can save its value.

- Delete a particular value and use it
particularValueSaved = list.pop(0)
# It does the same as .pop(), but you can pick one value per its index.

## Organize

- Sort permanently
list.sort()
#Alphabetically sorted, and you loose permanently the original order

- Sort temporarily
sortedView = list.sorted()
# You can sort it temporarily and recover the original order inmediately

- Reverse sort
messedList.sort(reverse=true)

- Reverse
list.reverse()
# You reverse the order of your elements, but not alphabetically, and you can recover the original order by applying the reverse operation again.
